<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The configuration of servers in getcal is the same than ics2qtcal.<br/>
The main idea is to get ics files (they can end by .ics or not) from a server passing some parameters to server.</p>

<h1>Username and Password</h1>
<p>To download these files, you may need to enter a <em>user name</em> and a <em>password</em>. These parameters are <em>not</em> mandatory.</p>

<h1>Server URL parameter and calendars</h1>
<p>There's a big probability that calendars (with .ics extension or not) files hosted on the same server will have a big part of their URL which is common.<br/>
The idea of <em>Server URL</em> is to place in it this big common part of URL and to save in <em>Calendars</em> the end of the URL which isn't shared.</p>

<h1>Example : one server with one user</h1>
<p>For example, if you use the Davical server on example.org you can have some calendars with this urls :</p>
<ol> 
<li>http://cal.example.org/davical.php/user1/Personnel</li>
<li>http://cal.example.org/davical.php/user1/Job.ics</li>
<li>http://cal.example.org/davical.php/user1/Birthdays</li>
</ol>
<p>In this case you'll write "http://cal.example.org/davical.php/user1" in <em>server URL</em> and you'll add calendars :</p>
<ol>
<li>Personnel</li>
<li>Job.ics</li>
<li>Birthdays</li>
</ol>

<h1>Example : one server with two users sharing calendars</h1>

<p>Let say that there's another user, user2, which have some calendars on the same Davical server and that user1 can access user2's calendars within the server.<br/>
In this case, instead of creating two servers with same user and password, you can set <em>server URL</em> parameter as this : "http://cal.example.org/davical.php/" and add calendars :</p>
<ol>
<li>user1/Personnel (so the end of URL)</li>
<li>user1/Job.ics</li>
<li>user1/Birthdays</li>
<li>_user2_/Birthdays (as it's the end of URL and user1 have access to user2's calendars)</li>
<li>_user2_/Personnel</li>
